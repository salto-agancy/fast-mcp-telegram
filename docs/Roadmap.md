# Product Roadmap

Official priorities for fast-mcp-telegram. Capability facts live in [Strategic-Market-Positioning.md](Strategic-Market-Positioning.md). Third-party Gemini research is under [research/](research/).

Last updated: 2026-06-15.

## North star

**The best Telegram bridge for AI agents** — 8 consolidated tools, MTProto access, zero-friction setup. Optimize for reliability, agent correctness, and distribution. Multi-user `http-auth` hosting is a downstream capability, not the organizing principle.

> **Why the shift?** Telemetry (ADR 0005) shows 96% of instances (23/24) run stdio local mode. Nobody uses ACL, bot tokens, or MTProto proxy. The actual user base wants a local Telegram MCP tool — not a multi-tenant gateway. The previous North Star ("shared http-auth multi-user hosting") organized the roadmap around a user segment that doesn't exist yet. This version reflects reality: make the tool excellent first, then extend to multi-user when there's evidence of demand.

## Roadmap lanes

Work is organized in **priority order**. The first three lanes reflect where the actual user base is (96% stdio local). Multi-user trust infrastructure is deferred until there's evidence of demand.

| Priority | Lane | Branch | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **P0** | **Quality & Reliability** | `master` | Fix real errors surfaced by telemetry: `get_messages` entity resolution, `search_messages_globally` query failures, reduce 25% error rate on production |
| **P1** | **Distribution** | `master` | Smithery listing, PyPI/uvx polish, README/Installation quality — get the tool in front of more users |
| **P2** | **QA / Gategrid** | `feature/evals` | Benchmark tool behavior with [Gategrid](https://github.com/leshchenko1979/gategrid) — **GG** — and enforce regressions via **GG gating** |
| **P3** | **Trust** | `feature/acl` | Agent guardrails per Bearer token — **deferred** until multi-user http-auth adoption grows. See [ADR 0001](adr/0001-agent-scoped-session-acl.md) |
| **Ongoing** | **Telemetry** | `master` *(shipped)* | Production signals that tell QA where agents and users struggle — see [ADR 0005](adr/0005-anonymous-tool-telemetry.md) |

### QA loop: telemetry → benchmark → gate

Telemetry and Gategrid serve different steps of the same **QA function**. Telemetry observes real usage; Gategrid proves fixes and blocks regressions.

| Step | Lane | What happens |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **1. Observe** | Telemetry | Collect structured signals from production: tool errors, `FLOOD_WAIT`, latency outliers, auth failures, repeated tool-selection mistakes. Surfaces *where* quality breaks in the wild. |
| **2. Decide** | QA | Turn telemetry findings into hypotheses and **GG case** candidates — new prompts, matrices, or baseline updates. Prioritize cases that match real failure modes. |
| **3. Benchmark** | QA / Gategrid | Run **GG** matrices (`smoke`, `gate`, optional live model) to measure pass rate, tool choice, and regressions vs baselines. Informs whether a tool or doc change actually helps agents. |
| **4. Assure** | QA / Gategrid | **GG gating** on PRs: `gategrid gate` against [evals/ci/baselines/main.json](../evals/ci/baselines/main.json) blocks merges when pass rate or like-for-like cells regress. |
| **5. Ship** | All lanes | Merge when trust, telemetry hooks, and gate are aligned for the change scope. |

**Today:** Steps 1–2 are live in production (telemetry DB collecting signals). Steps 3–4 are scaffolded on `feature/evals`. The next action is using telemetry data to drive P0 quality fixes and P2 case design.

## Branches

| Branch | Lane | Contents |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `master` | All active work | Roadmap, telemetry, QR login, feature work, Gemini research under [research/](research/) |
| `feature/evals` | QA / Gategrid | [evals/](../evals/), [gategrid-eval.yml](../.github/workflows/gategrid-eval.yml) |
| `feature/acl` | Trust *(deferred)* | Session ACL implementation and design docs — waiting for multi-user demand signal |
| `postponed/oidc-elicitation-storage` | OIDC *(superseded)* | Storage layer for OIDC + elicitation. Superseded by QR login. See [ADR 0004](adr/0004-qr-login-auth.md) |

> **Note:** The previous lane model assumed parallel feature branches for Trust, Telemetry, and QA. In practice, telemetry and QR login shipped directly to `master` via PRs. The lane model is now priority-ordered, not branch-ordered.

## Decisions (2026-06-15)

| Topic | Decision |
| --- | --- |
| **North Star** | Best Telegram bridge for AI agents — not multi-user hosting. Multi-user is a downstream capability. |
| **Priority model** | P0 Quality → P1 Distribution → P2 QA → P3 Trust. Lanes are priority-ordered, not branch-ordered. |
| **ACL** | Shipped but opt-in; deferred as a roadmap priority until multi-user http-auth adoption grows. |
| **Telemetry** | Shipped on `master` (ADR 0005). Now feeding QA triage with real production data. |
| **QA model** | Telemetry informs case design; **GG benchmark** validates; **GG gating** enforces on PR |
| **Evals** | Gategrid harness on `feature/evals`; not merged until gate is stable |
| **QR Login** | Shipped v0.30.0. Killed OIDC+elicitation complexity. The right auth model for the user base. |

### Previous decisions (2026-05-26, superseded)

<details>
<summary>Original lane model decisions</summary>

| Topic | Decision |
| --- | --- |
| ACL | Opt-in via `ACL_ENABLED`; per-token rules in static file — `feature/acl` |
| QA model | Telemetry informs case design; **GG benchmark** validates; **GG gating** enforces on PR |
| Evals | Gategrid harness on `feature/evals`; not merged until gate is stable |
| Telemetry | Separate lane; must feed QA triage before cases are added blindly |
| Post-ACL focus | Telemetry spike + eval expansion before rate limits / SQLite |

## Shipped on `master`

- QR Login Auth (v0.30.0) — Telethon QR login, unified `/setup` page, `@require_auth` decorator. Backward compatible with existing bearer tokens. See [ADR 0004](adr/0004-qr-login-auth.md)
- Anonymous Telemetry (ADR 0005) — opt-in production signal collection, PostgreSQL storage, per-tool error/latency tracking. See [ADR 0005](adr/0005-anonymous-tool-telemetry.md)
- [Strategic-Market-Positioning.md](Strategic-Market-Positioning.md) capability index
- Gemini research under [research/](research/) (third-party reference)
- Roadmap lane model (this document)

Trust and Gategrid evals merge from their feature branches when each lane is ready.

## Trust lane — planned scope

Operator-facing enhancements beyond ACL enforcement (not implemented):

| Item | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| **Sensitive peer denylist (Phase 1.5)** | Operator-configured `blocked_peers` denylist for **all** tokens when non-empty — independent of `chats` allowlist. Dual pre/post enforcement; recommended defaults in `acl.yaml.example` + SECURITY.md. See [ADR 0001](adr/0001-agent-scoped-session-acl.md), [acl-design-brief.md](research/acl-design-brief.md). |
| **Chat metadata registry** | Operator-curated metadata for whitelisted/shared chats so team agents can navigate `find_chats` results — human titles, descriptions, tags, and “look here for X” hints. Complements ACL **workspace lanes** (which chats a token may use) with **navigation hints** (what each chat is for); does not replace lane allowlists. Likely config alongside `acl.yaml` or a sibling file; enrichment at the tool boundary (e.g. post-filter on `find_chats`). |
| **Principal identifier forms** | **Admin ergonomics:** operators can key `principals:` entries by Telegram `@username` or numeric `user_id` instead of copying opaque Bearer strings — easier to assign lanes to people and audit who has which profile. **Semantics:** these are **alternative principal identifiers** for the same lane rules; they identify the **Telegram account** bound to a session (`{id}.session`), not chat peers listed under `chats:`. **Runtime unchanged:** HTTP clients still send `Authorization: Bearer <token>`; the server resolves identifiers to the matching session at config load or setup time. |
| **ACL chat ref resolution** | Resolve `@username` lane entries against numeric peer ids in tool args and list results (entity lookup), so operators need not duplicate id and handle in `chats`. |

See [acl-design-brief.md](research/acl-design-brief.md) Phase 1.5 and Phase 3 for related ACL work.

## Telemetry lane — current and planned signals

Shipped signals (ADR 0005): heartbeat, tool calls with latency/errors, session file counts, RSS memory, platform/version.

Candidate signals for next iteration (QA triage):

| Signal | QA use |
| --- | --- |
| Tool error rate by tool name | New or tightened GG cases for that tool |
| `FLOOD_WAIT` / connection errors | Rate-limit and caching decisions; stress cases |
| P95 tool latency | Performance regressions; matrix timing budgets |
| Wrong-tool patterns | Case prompts that require disambiguation |
| Auth / ACL denials | Security docs and negative-path cases |

## QA / Gategrid lane — current scope

See [evals/README.md](../evals/README.md) on branch `feature/evals`.

| Artifact | Role in QA loop |
| --- | --- |
| [evals/cases/](../evals/cases/) | User-language prompts → **benchmark** scenarios |
| [evals/matrices/](../evals/matrices/) | `smoke` vs `gate` run profiles |
| [evals/ci/baselines/main.json](../evals/ci/baselines/main.json) | Regression baseline for **GG gating** |
| [.github/workflows/gategrid-eval.yml](../.github/workflows/gategrid-eval.yml) | PR mock gate + manual live dispatch |

## Backlog (not sequenced)

| Item | Lane | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Sensitive peer denylist | Trust | Phase 1.5 — operator `blocked_peers` list + dual enforcement; see Trust lane planned scope |
| Principal identifier forms | Trust | Human-readable principal identifiers (`@username`, `user_id`) as alternatives to opaque ids — see [step 4](#current-sequence) and Trust lane |
| Per-token rate limits | Trust / ops | Complements telemetry FLOOD_WAIT signals |
| SQLite read cache | Performance | Pairs with ACL whitelists |
| ACL v2 permission matrix | Trust | Prgebish-style read/send per chat |
| Prompt-injection scanner | Trust | After ACL + QA coverage |
| OAuth2 / IdP | Enterprise | Federation path |
| **External session storage** (PostgreSQL / Redis) | Infrastructure | **Phase 2 of Smithery plan.** Persistent Telethon sessions for ephemeral deployments (Smithery Hosted). Options: PostgreSQL-backed session store or Redis-based StringSession cache. Unblocks userbot scenarios in hosted Docker environments. See [research/session-storage-design.md](research/session-storage-design.md) |
| **QR login auth** | ✅ **SHIPPED** | Auth | Telethon QR login — scan QR from Telegram mobile, no phone/OTP/2FA. Deployed at tg-mcp.l1979.ru. See [ADR 0004](adr/0004-qr-login-auth.md) |
| **Setup via agent dialog** | Infrastructure | ⛔ **SUPERSEDED** by QR login approach (see [ADR 0004](adr/0004-qr-login-auth.md)) — OIDC + MCP elicitation replaced by Telethon QR login |
| **Remote file upload (base64)** ✅ PR #103, #104, #105 | Features | `data:...;base64` inline payloads in `files` param (all modes). `;filename=name.ext` preserves original names. Images sent as inline photos, docs as documents. `tg-mcp-call` auto-inlines local paths as data: URIs. |
| Stdio path sandbox | Trust | Local stdio users |
| Multi-replica attachment tickets | Ops | Shared ticket store |
| Media OCR pipeline | Features | Beyond voice transcription |
| **Refactoring** | All lanes | Post-Phase-3 cleanup: consolidate session config, extract shared logic from `connection.py`/`server.py`, reduce duplication across transport modes, standardise error types. Unblocks faster iteration in subsequent phases. |
| **Docs review** | Docs / strategy | Post-Phase-3 audit: verify every public function has a docstring, every tool has usage examples, every ADR is up to date with code, all `TODO`s are intentional. Publish API reference. |

## Where to record future work

| Kind of item | Where to write it |
| --- | --- |
| Prioritized capability, lane, or backlog item | **This doc** — lane sections (`Trust`, `Telemetry`, `QA`) or [Backlog](#backlog-not-sequenced) |
| Design detail for an approved lane (phases, enforcement, config shape) | `docs/research/*-design-brief.md` (e.g. [acl-design-brief.md](research/acl-design-brief.md)) |
| Architectural decision with tradeoffs and consequences | `docs/adr/NNNN-*.md` (new ADR when the decision is settled) |
| Competitor notes, spikes, third-party research | `docs/research/` (reference only; link from Roadmap) |
| Current sprint focus and immediate next steps | `.cursor/memory-bank/activeContext.md` (3–5 items; not a substitute for Roadmap) |

**Rule of thumb:** Roadmap names *what* and *which lane*; research briefs spell *how*; ADRs record *why* a direction was chosen.
