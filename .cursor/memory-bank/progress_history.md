# Progress History (Archived 2025 Entries)

## 2026 Development History

### 2026-04-21
- **Attachment URL file_id passthrough**: `send_message(files=[<attachment_download_url>])` now intercepts our own URLs, looks up the ticket, and passes Telegram's `msg.media` directly to `send_file` — Telegram re-uploads from CDN via `file_id`, no bytes through our server. Works for all media types (photo, video, audio, document).
- **Single route pattern**: Attachment download URL now includes filename: `/v1/attachments/{uuid}/{filename}`. Photos get synthetic `photo_{msg_id}.jpg` since Telegram stores photos without filenames.
- **Route changed**: `attachment_routes.py` now uses single route `/{ticket_id}/{filename}` — `{filename}` ignored by handler.
- **Files modified**: `message_format.py`, `attachment_routes.py`, `file_handling.py` (`is_own_attachment_url` helper), `sending.py` (intercept + file_id passthrough).
- **Tests added**: `tests/test_file_id_passthrough.py` (11 tests covering URL detection, msg.media passthrough, fallback for unknown tickets and external URLs).

### 2026-03-29
- Archived older decisions from activeContext.md to progress_history.md for memory bank size compliance (293→65 lines)

### 2026-03-15
- Replaced aiohttp with httpx for file downloads in send_message tool (URL-based media attachments)
- Removed aiohttp dependency to consolidate on httpx (already used by FastMCP)

## 2025 Development History

### 2025-11-27 (Second Entry)
- **Todo List and Poll Support in read_messages**: Enhanced `read_messages` and `search_messages` to automatically detect and parse Telegram Todo lists (`MessageMediaToDo`) and Polls (`MessageMediaPoll`)
- **Todo List Parsing**: Added structured parsing of TodoList objects extracting title, items, completion status, timestamps, and user information
- **Poll Parsing**: Implemented comprehensive Poll object parsing including questions, options, vote counts, and poll metadata
- **Media Recognition**: Updated `_has_any_media()` to recognize `MessageMediaToDo` for proper content detection

- **Enhanced Error Handling**: Added `success.html` and `error.html` fragments with user-friendly messaging and navigation
- **Security Validation**: Implemented comprehensive validation including reserved name blocking, session existence checks, and authorization status verification
- **Backward Compatibility**: Maintained existing new session creation flow while adding reauthorization capability
- **Bearer Token Reserved Name Protection**: Added validation to prevent reserved session names like "telegram" from being used as bearer tokens, preventing session file conflicts and maintaining isolation between HTTP_AUTH and STDIO modes.

- **Backward Compatibility**: Existing simple parameters continue to work unchanged while complex objects are now supported

### 2025-11-19
- **Public Visibility Filtering Implementation**: Added `public: bool | None` parameter to `search_messages_globally` and `find_chats` tools with architectural rule that private chats should never be filtered by visibility
- **Boolean Parameter Design**: `public=True` finds entities with usernames (publicly discoverable), `public=False` finds entities without usernames (invite-only), `public=None` disables filtering
- **Private Chat Protection**: Private chats (direct messages with users) are automatically excluded from public filtering - they always appear regardless of the `public` parameter value
- **Core Filtering Logic**: Updated `_matches_public_filter()` in `entity.py` to return `True` for all private chats regardless of username presence
- **Search Implementation**: Modified `search.py` to use boolean public filtering in all search generators and helper functions
- **Contact Implementation**: Updated chat discovery / entity search to apply public filtering to contact searches while protecting private chats
- **Tool Registration**: Added `public` parameter to both search tools with clear documentation and examples
- **Documentation Updates**: Updated TypeScript signatures, examples, and descriptions to reflect boolean parameter and private chat protection
- **Version Bump**: Incremented version from 0.8.4 to 0.9.0 to reflect the major architectural change
- **Testing Validation**: Verified that private chats are never filtered while groups/channels are filtered normally
- **Live Deployment**: Successfully deployed and tested the new functionality in production VDS environment
